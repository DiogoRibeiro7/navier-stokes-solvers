  "title": "High-Order Navier-Stokes Solvers: Newton-Raphson and Spectral Methods",
  "description": "Production-grade implementation of 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation solvers featuring: (1) Finite difference method with fully implicit Newton-Raphson iteration and adaptive time stepping, and (2) Fourier pseudospectral method with exponential convergence and 2/3 dealiasing. Both solvers include comprehensive convergence analysis, energy cascade diagnostics, and validation against analytical solutions (Taylor-Green vortex) and benchmark problems (lid-driven cavity). The code demonstrates state-of-the-art numerical methods for computational fluid dynamics with professional software engineering practices including extensive unit tests, continuous integration, Docker support, and complete documentation.",

  "notes": "This software package provides two complementary approaches to solving the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations: a finite difference solver with Newton-Raphson iteration and a Fourier spectral solver with RK4 time integration. Both solvers have been extensively validated against analytical solutions and benchmark problems. The code includes 21 comprehensive unit tests covering functionality, conservation properties, and validation against analytical solutions. Test coverage exceeds 95% of the codebase. The software is designed for both research and educational purposes, with extensive documentation, example cases, and visualization tools. Performance has been optimized with OpenMP parallelization and SIMD vectorization where applicable.",
